# Video View Analysis Based on User Verification Status
## Project Overview
The objective of this part of the project was to investigate whether verification status influences the number of views a userâ€™s video receives. Descriptive statistics were generated to summarize video metrics, followed by hypothesis testing to identify significant differences between verified and unverified users.

## Data Understanding
The analysis focused on video view counts for two independent groups: verified and unverified users. The variables were right-skewed, and population standard deviations were unknown, making a two-sample t-test appropriate for comparing group means.

## Modeling and Evaluation
An independent two-sample t-test was performed to determine whether the mean video view counts differed between verified and unverified users.

### Test Results
- The results indicated a **statistically significant difference** in the mean number of views for videos posted by verified versus unverified users.

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that verification status is associated with video view counts, with verified users receiving significantly different (likely higher) average views compared to unverified users.
