# Google_Advanced_Data_Analytics__Course_4_Project__TikTok_Hypothesis_Testing

In this part of the project, descriptive statistics were generated, followed by an independent two-sample t-test to determine whether there was a significant difference in the average video view counts between verified and unverified users. This test was appropriate because the two groups were independent of each other, the population standard deviations were unknown, and the variables exhibited right-skewness.

The test results indicated a statistically significant difference in the mean number of views for videos by verified and unverified users.
